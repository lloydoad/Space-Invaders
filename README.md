# Space-Invaders

This is just my attempt to familiarize myself with some basic java concepts. I learnt a lot in the project. Mostly, how to google things and how amazing the Oracle documentations really are. I hope to add more features in the future. Hopefully, difficulty level, static animations, and highscore system will be added soon.

Features:
- Multipanel control system for switching between main menu and game.
- Start, Pause, and Stop methods
- Using ActionListeners between different classes
- Controlling velocity of different moving objects
- Deleting unnecessary graphics (off screen bullets)
- Disposing unnecessary graphics to reduce CPU usage

- Lloyd Dapaah (nass)
